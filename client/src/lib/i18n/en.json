      "AI is growing rapidly. Companies that start now gain an advantage. Those who wait will soon be watching competitors who moved faster. The question is no longer whether you use AI, but how fast you begin.",
      "We believe speed makes the difference. No months of talking about what might be possible, but tangible results within 30 days. We build tools that work immediately. Automate processes, relieve teams, reduce errors. First we tested it for ourselves, now we help others do the same.",
      "AI delivers peace and profit. More output with less chaos. Working more productively, more focus on what truly matters. But that doesn't happen automatically. It happens by starting. Let's switch."

Sold it successfully to his partner.\n\nTechnically strong, but with clear focus: technology must work in practice. Simple enough that teams actually use it.\n\nWith AI he saw the same pattern as with BI. Companies wanted it, but it often went wrong. Too theoretical, too complex, too little concrete application.\n\nRob takes a different approach. Not another dashboard that two people are excited about. But tools that the entire team uses. Automate processes. Structure data.\n\nWhat makes him unique: technical precision combined with pragmatism. He can do complex, but chooses simplicity.\n\nAt Schakel AI, Rob builds it, tests it, makes it operational. So that within four weeks you have something that demonstrably saves."

Started as an employee, became co-owner after six years, optimized the business and sold it successfully.\n\nWhen AI broke through, he saw the problem: half of his measures became obsolete. Too slow, too expensive for what AI could do in weeks. Turning point: keep doing what worked, or switch to what works.\n\nSimon chose the latter. Not to talk about AI, but to concretely move organizations forward.\n\nWhat drives him? No patience for theoretical plans. He wants concrete results. Processes from 20 hours to 2 hours. Eliminate errors. Measurable, within 30 days.\n\nHe combines 11 years of transformation experience with a no-nonsense approach. Where others present roadmaps, Simon builds a working solution.\n\nHis role at Schakel AI: ensuring you focus on what has impact now. Start small, build proof, then scale."
