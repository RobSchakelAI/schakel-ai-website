      "bio": "In 2018 Rob switched from accounting to Business Intelligence. This was still in its infancy, but he saw the potential. He dove in completely, started freelancing and soon founded Easydash. An agency that helped companies truly utilize data.\n\nThe start was tough. Companies didn't see the point. \"We have Excel, that works fine.\" But as soon as the first results became visible, things moved fast. Within a few years, everyone was using BI tools.\n\nThen came AI. Rob sold Easydash to his partner and stepped into a new world once again. And again he saw the same pattern: skepticism, doubt, waiting. \"We don't know if it works.\" While the frontrunners are already building, learning and winning.\n\nBut AI affects more than reports. It changes entire companies. From customer service to operations, from marketing to decision-making. The impact is bigger, so the urgency is too.\n\nThat's why he founded Schakel AI. Not to talk about AI, but to help companies actually apply it. At Schakel, Rob ensures ideas become reality. Rob is a builder who dives deep into technology, masters tools and builds smart things that really work."

Started as an employee, became co-owner after six years, optimized the business and sold it successfully.\n\nWhen AI broke through, he saw it: optimizing processes took him months, AI did it in weeks. That opened doors. Keep doing what worked, or fully switch to what became possible? Simon chose the latter.\n\nNot to talk about AI, but to concretely move organizations forward with practical implementations.\n\nWhat drives him? No patience for theoretical plans that disappear in a drawer. He wants to see processes truly become more efficient. From 20 hours of manual work to automated flows. From error-prone input to reliable systems.\n\nThose 11 years of transformation experience taught him one thing: organizations don't need roadmaps, but concrete first steps. Where others start with strategic analyses, Simon starts with the processes that cost the most time right now.\n\nAt Schakel AI, he ensures the focus remains on one thing: results."
