Sold it successfully to his partner.\n\nTechnically strong, but with clear focus: technology must work in practice. Simple enough that teams actually use it.\n\nWith AI he saw the same pattern as with BI. Companies wanted to implement it, but it often got stuck. Too theoretical, too complex, too little connection to daily practice.\n\nRob takes a different approach. Not building dashboards that two people look at. But solutions the entire team works with. Automate processes that are currently manual. Structure data that is currently scattered.\n\nHe combines that technical background with pragmatism. He can build complex, but deliberately chooses solutions that people immediately understand and use.\n\nAt Schakel AI, Rob ensures ideas become reality. From concept to working solution that delivers measurable results."

Started as an employee, became co-owner after six years, optimized the business and sold it successfully.\n\nWhen AI broke through, he saw it: optimizing processes took him months, AI did it in weeks. That opened doors. Keep doing what worked, or fully switch to what became possible? Simon chose the latter.\n\nNot to talk about AI, but to concretely move organizations forward with practical implementations.\n\nWhat drives him? No patience for theoretical plans that disappear in a drawer. He wants to see processes truly become more efficient. From 20 hours of manual work to automated flows. From error-prone input to reliable systems.\n\nThose 11 years of transformation experience taught him one thing: organizations don't need roadmaps, but concrete first steps. Where others start with strategic analyses, Simon starts with the processes that cost the most time right now.\n\nAt Schakel AI, he ensures the focus remains on one thing: results."
