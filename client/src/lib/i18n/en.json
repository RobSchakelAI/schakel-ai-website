He's a nerd who loves to dive deep into new technologies and figure out how things really work. The same happened with AI: he wanted to understand it completely. That technical precision and attention to detail enable him to translate complexity into workable solutions that not only work, but are also visually attractive and user-friendly. Because technology is only valuable when people actually use it."

When AI really broke through, he saw that half measures weren't enough anymore. He chose to fully switch and dive into AI. He combines commercial thinking with process knowledge and knows how to bring people along. No theoretical plans, but concrete steps that truly move organizations forward."
