  <article>
    <p>In my previous post, I wrote about the shift from tools to autonomous systems. About software that doesn&#39;t just support, but performs work. And about the moment when software gains insight into its own quality and can improve itself: <a href="/blog/toekomst-van-software">the future of software</a>.</p>
<p>Nice story, right? Now let&#39;s put it into practice.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you try to turn theory into practice, using our own Meeting Automation Platform (MAP) as a testing ground.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What we ran into</h2>
<p>Our MAP does what it&#39;s supposed to do, but right now it&#39;s still a linear flow. Fetching transcripts, creating meeting notes, storing documents on SharePoint, preparing emails in Outlook, creating tasks in Productive. It works and it saves us real time.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s fine for now. But we&#39;re not just building for today, we&#39;re building to learn what&#39;s possible and how we can prepare for those possibilities. So the question we asked ourselves was: how can we build our meeting platform now in a way that allows us to expand it into an agentic system?</p>
<hr>
<h2>From fixed pipeline to building blocks</h2>
<p>The core of what we&#39;re changing now is this: every action the platform performs becomes a standalone &quot;capability&quot;. No longer part of a flow, but a self-contained building block.</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch_transcript</li>
<li>summarize_meeting</li>
<li>upload_document</li>
<li>create_tasks</li>
<li>send_followup_draft</li>
</ul>
<p>All separate building blocks that we can combine. At its core, this seems like simply a variable, a piece of code you use or reuse somewhere, but by enriching it, it becomes more than that.</p>
<p>Each capability has an extensive description of what it does, what it needs, what it produces, with validation and clear boundaries. And important metadata such as: Is this action destructive? Does it create something in external systems? Is it reversible? Does it require human approval?</p>
<p>All this metadata isn&#39;t currently needed for how the system is used, but we will need it later. Because if you want software to autonomously decide which steps are needed, it must know what&#39;s possible, what it has access to, how it works, what&#39;s safe, what&#39;s risky, what needs human involvement.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s where the difference with &quot;just building modularly&quot; lies. We&#39;re not building this to make code cleaner or more reusable. We&#39;re building this so that &quot;an agent&quot; can later combine these capabilities. So that software no longer has to follow a fixed process, but can determine for itself: for this type of meeting I need these steps, for that type different ones. And for that, each capability must not only be technically standalone, but also be described in a way that an AI can interpret.</p>
<p>That makes it fundamentally different. And although our MAP doesn&#39;t require this yet, we want to set it up this way now. Because we&#39;re going to build that agent and we&#39;re going to give it access to the capabilities within our application.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning from what people correct</h2>
<p>And then the second thing we&#39;re building in: feedback loops.</p>
<p>Every time we adjust something — change a summary, correct a category, delete a task — we log it. Not as an error, but as a signal. We&#39;re not doing anything with it yet, but we&#39;re collecting. Because if software needs to learn, you first need to see where it deviates from what we want.</p>
<p>That data, about where the AI did things differently than we wanted, will form the basis for: &quot;This category is never recognized correctly, we need to adjust the description&quot;. Or &quot;long sentences are always removed from the minutes, let&#39;s adjust the AI prompt&quot;. Or &quot;these tasks are always immediately deleted or checked off, let&#39;s just mention them but not define them as tasks&quot;.</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t built this yet, let alone have it working autonomously. But the first parts of the infrastructure are in place. We log the deviations, the retries. And we&#39;re starting to see patterns. And that&#39;s already very educational, because you see where the AI systematically deviates from what people want. And those are sometimes things you expect, but often not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Smarter yes, blind trust no</h2>
<p>Software that decides for itself, that learns, that adapts, that sounds a bit scary. And rightly so. But it is where the world is heading and that&#39;s why we&#39;re building in control from the start.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Every action that creates something outside our platform — a task in Productive, an email in Outlook, a document on SharePoint — first goes through an approval flow. We log everything. And we/the users determine which steps may happen automatically and which may not.</p>
<p>Our MAP is getting smarter, but we remain in control. Because autonomy without control isn&#39;t progress, it&#39;s a risk.</p>
<p>Getting smarter? Yes. Blind trust? No.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What this delivers</h2>
<p>Right now, not much is changing on the frontend. The biggest gains are under the hood. But what we&#39;re building now? That&#39;s the foundation for something that will work completely differently in 6 months, a year. When our system starts improving itself and when we&#39;ve built one or more &quot;agents&quot; that can perform tasks in our platform. First still at our request and after our explicit approval, but later autonomously.</p>
<p>We&#39;re building the foundation now so those steps are possible later.</p>
<p>And what&#39;s really the coolest part: how much you learn by just building. Not just reading or watching YouTube videos about AI, but actually building, applying, learning, and improving yourself. Then you learn what&#39;s really possible, what it really means, and you start to see the infinite possibilities of what we can all build.</p>
<p>Simon and I say to each other weekly: &quot;If you can imagine it, you can build it&quot;. And that&#39;s really true.</p>
<p>And you don&#39;t learn that from a blog, or book, a YouTube video, or an &quot;AI Masterclass&quot;. You discover it by just doing it, building, and seeing what happens.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Where this is heading (and where we&#39;re far from)</h2>
<p>This is phase 1. The next steps?</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#39;re going to build an agent that can use capabilities at our request (phase 2)</li>
<li>Then we let that agent decide which capabilities are needed when (phase 3)</li>
<li>Next, the platform will make suggestions based on patterns (phase 4)</li>
<li>And finally? Fully agentic: it adapts itself, with control, but without us having to be there constantly (phase 5)</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#39;re far from there. But we&#39;re building towards it, step by step, and it&#39;s really exciting to see how each step reveals new questions, new challenges, and new possibilities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What I&#39;ve learned so far</h2>
<p>Autonomous, self-learning software isn&#39;t magic, isn&#39;t a feature. It&#39;s deliberately chosen architecture. You have to design it from the ground up. And that means making choices that seem unnecessary now: adding structures, foundations, and metadata that we don&#39;t use yet, collecting feedback that we don&#39;t analyze yet. But without that foundation, you won&#39;t get there.</p>
<p>We&#39;re building our MAP partly as a tool we use daily, and partly as a testing ground to discover for ourselves, in practice, where the future of software can go if you actively and experimentally build towards it.</p>
<p>Sometimes something works really well. Sometimes it crashes. Sometimes the AI does something totally unexpected that makes you think: &quot;Wait... that&#39;s actually smarter than what I had thought of.&quot;</p>
<p>But it&#39;s always educational. Always a step forward.</p>
<p>AI, agents, living software. Trendy buzzwords being thrown around, but they really gain meaning and substance when you start building. An agentic system? We&#39;re unintentionally but inevitably building towards it, and I&#39;m curious what we&#39;ll encounter along the way.</p>
