  <article>
    <p>In an earlier post, I described how our Meeting Automation Center slowly &quot;got out of hand.&quot; What started as a simple automation grew into a full-fledged platform with dashboards, configuration layers, and operational control. Not because we planned it that way, but because building pushed us in that direction.</p>
<p>That building journey made one thing clear: this story isn&#39;t just about meetings. It touches on something bigger. A fundamental shift in how software relates to work.</p>
<p>In this post, I therefore zoom out. Away from our own tooling, away from implementation details. What happens to software when it no longer primarily supports, but actually performs work? And where does &quot;smart SaaS&quot; end, and something else begin?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why the current software model is hitting its limits</h2>
<p>Over the past twenty years, our work life has been digitized in the form of SaaS. CRMs, project management tools, HR systems, portals, dashboards. All built with the same premise: helping people do their work more efficiently.</p>
<p>And that has brought enormous benefits. Work became more transparent, processes repeatable, information accessible.</p>
<p>But despite all those tools, we still spend a large part of our time on manual work. We type, click, copy, paste, write emails, forward tasks. Digital aids, but the work itself remains remarkably human-intensive.</p>
<p>They are tools. But the user still has to do the work.</p>
<p>We&#39;re at a tipping point. Software is fundamentally changing. And not in the form of yet another app, yet another interface, yet another feature.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The big shift: from applications to autonomous systems</h2>
<p>AI is changing not only how we interact with software, but what software essentially is.</p>
<p>Instead of applications that revolve around screens, buttons, and features, systems emerge that revolve around goals and processes. Workflow-native software. Not: &quot;click here to do something,&quot; but: this is the work that needs to happen – handle it.</p>
<p>This requires software that can carry context. Not because it &quot;understands everything,&quot; but because context is explicitly captured: in data, in templates, in rules, in preferences, in roles and permissions. Context isn&#39;t magic. It&#39;s design.</p>
<p>And it requires autonomy. Not complete autonomy, not blind trust, but systems that independently execute steps: summarizing, structuring, enriching, following up, communicating. Without a human having to be in between every time.</p>
<p>Autonomy here doesn&#39;t yet mean &quot;deciding for itself,&quot; but reliably executing within clear boundaries. Without insight, control, and limitation, autonomy becomes not progress, but a risk.</p>
<hr>
<h2>From tools to capabilities</h2>
<p>In this way of thinking, how software is built also shifts. Large, all-encompassing applications gradually make way for smaller building blocks: capabilities.</p>
<p>A capability is not a feature and not a button, but an independent action that software can perform. Fetching something. Classifying something. Structuring something. Storing something. Communicating something. With a clear goal, an explicit input and output contract, and clear boundaries.</p>
<p>The power lies not in the individual capability, but in how they are combined. Capabilities together form workflows — not hard-coded as one fixed process, but composable based on how an organization works.</p>
<p>This shifts something fundamental. The process itself no longer becomes a product feature, but a composition of building blocks. The sequence, conditions, and exceptions are no longer fixed in code, but made explicit.</p>
<p>Up to this point, this still feels like &quot;just very well-configured SaaS.&quot; And honestly: up to here, it is.</p>
<p>But then….</p>
<hr>
<h2>From configurable workflows to learning systems</h2>
<p>As long as software only executes what is configured, it remains configuration. However smart. However flexible. The human designs the process, the software executes it, and the human adjusts it again when it doesn&#39;t work well.</p>
<p>The next step emerges when software gains visibility into the quality of its own output.</p>
<p>When a system (let&#39;s take our own Meeting Automation Platform as an example) can see where people intervene:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes that are adjusted</li>
<li>tasks that are deleted</li>
<li>emails that aren&#39;t sent</li>
<li>workflows that are re-executed</li>
</ul>
<p>signals emerge. Not errors, but feedback. Information about what works and what doesn&#39;t. From that moment, software can do more than execute. It can recognize patterns and make suggestions:</p>
<p>&quot;This template or prompt often leads to corrections.&quot;
&quot;This step is almost always skipped.&quot;
&quot;This sequence works better in similar contexts.&quot;
&quot;Would you like to configure this differently?&quot;</p>
<p>Here autonomy shifts from execution to improvement.</p>
<p>Not by randomly changing processes, but by making evidence-based suggestions. First with the human at the wheel. With proof. With context. With the ability to accept or reject.</p>
<p>How exactly you build this is anything but trivial. We&#39;re only now really discovering that.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why this is fundamentally different from smart SaaS</h2>
<p>Good SaaS can be flexible. Configurable. Extensible. But the process model is almost always fixed. Configuration adjusts parameters; it rarely changes the process itself.</p>
<p>Software that can evaluate its own behavior and attach consequences to it breaks through that boundary. Workflows become objects that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are versioned</li>
<li>are measured</li>
<li>can be compared</li>
<li>evolve over time</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not hype and not science fiction. It&#39;s a logical consequence of systems that perform work at scale and analyze and use that output.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What this means for businesses and builders</h2>
<p>Software becomes tailor-made and personal, very personal. It adapts to how the business works instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>For businesses, the question shifts. Less: &quot;what tools do we need?&quot; More: &quot;what work do we want to happen autonomously, and where do we want insight and control?&quot;</p>
<p>For software builders, the role changes at least as much. We design not only functions, but behavior. Not only execution, but feedback loops. Not only code, but systems that understand how well they perform.</p>
<p>This requires maturity: logging, observability, version control, rollback. Not as an afterthought, but as a foundation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>We&#39;re far from finished. Systems that learn are fragile. AI makes mistakes. Sometimes subtle, sometimes visible.</p>
<p>But precisely because of this, this moment is interesting. Not because everything is already possible, but because we&#39;re now discovering what software looks like when it doesn&#39;t just support, but actually performs work… and slowly learns how that work can be done better.</p>
<p>Software is shifting. From tools to workflows. From workflows to capabilities. From capabilities to systems that can improve.</p>
<p>Not in one big leap, but in small, controlled steps.</p>
<p>In the next post, I&#39;ll discuss how we&#39;re trying to build this in practice. And… what we&#39;re learning along the way. We&#39;re tirelessly curious about all the possibilities and discoveries, and we&#39;re building toward the future!</p>
