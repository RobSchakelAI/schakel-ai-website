### Latest Writing: AI Coding Tools Begrijpen: De Drie Lagen van Moderne Development
- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/ai-coding-tools-begrijpen
- Static HTML: https://www.schakel.ai/_seo/blog/ai-coding-tools-begrijpen/
- Published: January 26, 2026
- Author: Rob van Zutphen
- Topic: Understanding the three layers of AI coding tools and how to combine them cost-effectively
- Key Topics: AI coding tools, vibecoding, OpenCode, Claude Code, Replit, Cursor, AI development, coding agents, IDE comparison, Claude Opus, terminal agents
- Reading Time: 10 minutes
- Summary: Comprehensive explanation of the three layers of modern AI-assisted development: (1) IDE/Environment - where you code (local vs cloud), (2) AI Coding Agent - the software that gives AI models tools to work with code (terminal-based vs IDE-integrated), (3) AI Model - the actual intelligence (Claude, GPT, etc.). Explains the crucial difference between IDEs, agents, and models that many developers confuse. Includes a practical hack: combining Replit (cloud IDE) with OpenCode (open source terminal agent) and Claude Opus 4.5 (via personal subscription) to save 800-900 euros per month compared to using Replit Agent 3. Covers why agents deliver 90% of the value, the trade-offs between different setups, and who each setup is best suited for.

- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/zenuwstelsel-van-ons-bedrijf
- Static HTML: https://www.schakel.ai/_seo/blog/zenuwstelsel-van-ons-bedrijf/
- Published: December 20, 2025
- Author: Simon Voorbergen
- Topic: How Schakel AI views AI automation - three layers of automating, enriching, and unlocking potential
- Key Topics: AI automation, Meeting Automation Platform, MAP, operational nervous system, AI strategy, process automation, agentic AI, AI implementation, autonomous systems
- Reading Time: 5 minutes
- Summary: Explains Schakel AI's three-layer approach to AI automation: (1) automate processes to stop wasting time, (2) enrich processes to enable new capabilities, (3) unlock full business potential by organizing smarter. Covers why AI projects fail (starting too big, talking instead of building, lack of ownership, missing control) and what works (start with one process, build within 30 days, measure results). Introduces MAP as the "operational nervous system" - not a meeting tool but proof of how autonomous, controllable AI systems take over processes without losing grip. Emphasizes the shift from capturing to steering with management data.

### Previous Writing: De toekomst van software: van tools naar autonome workflows
- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/toekomst-van-software
- Static HTML: https://www.schakel.ai/_seo/blog/toekomst-van-software/
- Published: December 19, 2025
- Author: Rob van Zutphen
- Topic: The fundamental shift from SaaS tools to autonomous workflow systems
- Key Topics: autonomous workflows, capabilities, learning systems, workflow automation, SaaS future, agentic systems, AI automation, software architecture, feedback loops, MeetingOps
- Reading Time: 5 minutes
- Summary: Analysis of the fundamental shift in how software relates to work. Covers why the current SaaS model is hitting its limits, the emergence of workflow-native software with capabilities instead of features, and the transition from configurable workflows to learning systems that can evaluate their own output and suggest improvements. Emphasizes that context is design (not magic), autonomy means reliable execution within clear boundaries, and the shift from "which tools do we need" to "which work should happen autonomously."

### Previous Writing: Waarom AI pas werkt als je het organiseert
- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/ai-organiseren-voor-resultaat
- Static HTML: https://www.schakel.ai/_seo/blog/ai-organiseren-voor-resultaat/
- Published: December 18, 2025
- Author: Simon Voorbergen
- Topic: Why AI only works when you organize it properly - the difference between AI as a project vs AI as part of operations
- Key Topics: AI strategy, AI implementation, organizational change, AI frameworks, AI operations, structure for AI, AI adoption, rust en rendement, AI consultancy, process optimization
- Reading Time: 4 minutes
- Summary: Analysis of why AI fails not due to intent but due to lack of organizational structure. Companies that succeed with AI have a consistent way of working - choosing where to start, connecting AI to concrete processes, working in clear sequence, proving value before scaling, and securing what works. Emphasizes that AI is operations, not innovation, and requires reliability, predictability, and embedded ownership.

### Previous Writing: Waarom structuur belangrijker is dan technologie
- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/waarom-structuur-belangrijker-is-dan-technologie
- Published: December 11, 2025
- Author: Simon Voorbergen
- Topic: Why over 80% of AI projects fail and how structure, not technology, determines success
- Key Topics: AI implementation failure, organizational structure, process optimization, improvement cycles, Quick Wins, AI ROI, RAND Corporation research, McKinsey AI research
- Reading Time: 10 minutes
- Summary: Analysis of why most AI initiatives fail - not due to technical complexity, but because organizations lack the structure to succeed. Covers the common misconception that tooling solves strategic challenges, why companies get stuck testing tools without implementing, and how leading organizations approach AI differently by focusing on one problem at a time with a clear improvement cycle. Emphasizes "rust, ritme, rendement" (calm, rhythm, results) as the key to successful AI adoption.

### Previous Writing: Niet meer bouwen met low-code
- URL: https://www.schakel.ai/blog/niet-meer-bouwen-met-low-code
- Published: December 8, 2025
- Author: Rob van Zutphen
- Topic: Why we skip low-code and go all-in on vibecoding (AI-assisted full-code development)
- Key Topics: vibecoding, low-code vs full-code, AI-assisted development, Replit, Lovable, Cursor, software ownership, vendor lock-in, modular stack
- Reading Time: 8 minutes
- Summary: Analysis of why the low-code sweet spot is disappearing in the AI era. Covers four main arguments: (1) AI has lowered the barrier to real code, (2) low-code creates vendor lock-in while vibecoding gives ownership, (3) modern AI models produce consistent, production-quality code, (4) humans still control architecture and security. Includes research citations from McKinsey, Stanford AI Index, Microsoft Research, and Harvard/MIT/Boston University on AI-assisted development productivity gains.
